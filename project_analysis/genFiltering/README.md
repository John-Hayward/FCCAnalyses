# Applying Filters at Generator Level.

This code shows the basic method I used for generating MC Level filtered events (as of ~March 2024 so may be outdated). Both the exact configurables used are included, as well as simple python scripts to generate files to be run in batch for larger samples. `make_sh_files.py` produces 100 shell scripts to generate filtered samples defined by a `pythiaEventsFiltered.py` file. These are then saved, along with the last 100 lines of standard output to get the filter efficiency, to a defined location on eos. `make_job_sub/py` produces a single .job file toexecute these 100 shell scripts using the batch computing service.

An example `pythiaEventsFiltered.py` file can also be seen, which defines parameters used in the event generation, such as the pythia card and delphes card to be used, the number of successful events to generate, and the filter rule. This filter rule is defined to run over the particles and return true if an event satisfies the desired criteria, an example of which can also be seen
