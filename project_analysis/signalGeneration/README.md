#Description of signal generation code

Decays of Z bosons to Majorana HNLs were simulated based on the madgraph cards located in `./mg5_cards`. These were then simulated through the delphes configuration for the winter2023 backgrounds as can be found at `https://github.com/HEP-FCC/FCC-config/tree/winter2023/FCCee/Delphes`.
